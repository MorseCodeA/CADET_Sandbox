<p>While using the CADET backend API, it would be useful to acquire specific
details of the data existing within the CADET backend database. Data in the
database is constituted of pre- and post-processed data. Retrieving this data,
a subset of this data, or information about this data (collectively metadata)
without re-processing the dataset through the Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tools is a necessity.</p>
<p>The CADET data layer will implement several methods of accessing metadata
stored in the backend database. Existing pre-processed data and results from
NLP tools stored in the database are likely to be comparatively large in size.
This metadata will be available to gather more information about the existing
data, and to help decide which data to request from the database before
requesting a large, unneeded blob of data. Access to this metadata will be
available in the form of GET requests made to the CADET backend API.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>Pre-processed data, in the form of comments submitted to the CADET system, and
the results of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, stored immediately
in the CADET backend database, are likely to be large chunks of uncompressed
text. In order to reduce the amount of data transmitted between the CADET
backend API and the user, the CADET backend API shall implement a process of
retrieving metadata about the existing datasets populating the database. This
metadata can be used to more effectively find information of interest existing
within the CADET backend database.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Getting the number of comments in a specified dataset</li>
<li>Getting the range of semesters of a specified dataset</li>
<li>Retrieving the current Topic Option ID from the NLP tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Properly formed tables with read/write access to the database</li>
<li>Valid data being input into database tables</li>
<li>Method of accessing database tables</li>
<li>Web framework with the ability to define custom functions</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The user requests the results of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools
on a specific dataset after the dataset is processed and stored in a table.
The user requests these results via a GET request to the appropriate URL
corresponding to the table and ID of the results. The results get sent back
to the user via a HTTP response with a <a class="citation-reference" href="#json" id="id1">[JSON]</a> object describing the
results.</li>
<li>The user requests metadata of a dataset stored in a table prior to
processing or metadata of a result after processing. The user requests the
metadata via a GET request via to the appropriate URL corresponding to the
table and ID of the requested metadata. The metadata gets sent back to the
user via a HTTP response with a JSON object describing the metadata.</li>
<li>The user requests data or metadata through a GET request to a URL
corresponding to data that does not exist. The user will receive a HTTP
response with a JSON object containing an error field and an appropriate
error code. The user should check for errors after receiving any response
from the CADET backend API.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>The CADET data layer is being implemented in <a class="citation-reference" href="#flask" id="id2">[Flask]</a>, a lightweight web
framework, with a <a class="citation-reference" href="#restful" id="id3">[RESTful]</a> API. Implementing functions for GET requests to
several URLs is relatively straightforward in Flask. Flask provides decorators
to link functions as request handlers. These custom request handlers will
retrieve the requested information from the database and wrap them neatly in a
JSON object to be returned to the requester via an HTTP response.</p>
<p>The URL to access resources (via a RESTful GET request) would be in one of the
following formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/fields</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;field&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Details on how these URLs are used are covered below in the &quot;Implementation&quot;
section.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Other options include not storing the dataset in a database. This limits a
users workflow to one dataset at a time. With the inclusion of a database a
user can work on multiple datasets concurrently. The inclusion of a database
necessitates the need to pull data from the database and send it to the user.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to implement the solution utilizing the Django web
framework instead of Flask. Django is a full suite of web tools, including a
built-in ORM for database management. Django is a poor fit for this project
because it is not as modular as Flask and has unneeded functionality,
resulting in larger overhead, for a simple &quot;store and process&quot; server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Test plans for this feature include making connections to both valid and
invalid resources (tables or elements in the tables) in the database. Expected
results are discussed in the Proposed Changes section.</p>
<p>Connections can be made through a multitude of methods however scripting via
<a class="citation-reference" href="#curl" id="id4">[curl]</a> will be sufficient for testing this feature. Multiple requests can be
sent individually through curl with manual validation of the output/returned
object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Inline comments should be used to describe the action being taken in the
functions handling the request. These comments shall be in a block comment
above the function and include separate comments explaining lines of code that
do not self-document. If there is a need to update the functions handling the
requests, the inline comments should be the first thing to reference.</p>
<p>There needs to be user documentation for these requests. This documentation
should include how to request the data, how to look up more data, and the
expected return value for each request type. This might be handled in the
documentation covering the whole API for this project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<div class="section" id="work-items">
<h2>Work Items</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Implementation - this feature can be implemented using several functions
handling the requests. A function that can handle each &quot;class&quot; of requests,
mentioned in the Proposed Changes section, can be made, and linked via the
Flask decorators.</li>
<li>The URL to access resources (via a RESTful GET request) would be in one of
the following formats:<ul>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/fields</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.example.com/CADETProc">http://www.example.com/CADETProc</a>/&lt;table&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/&lt;field&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To access a table in the CADET backend database and retrieve the elements in
the table, a GET request can be made to the first of the above example URLs.
The request will be handled via a function with a Flask decorator capturing
the request, which will then return the elements existing in the table to
the user. As an example, a GET request made to &quot;/CADETProc/comments&quot; shall
return a list of all the comment IDs that exist in the database table
&quot;comments&quot;. When the specified table does not exist, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error
shall be returned to the user.</li>
<li>To retrieve a list of columns, or fields, that exist within a specified
table, a GET request can be made to the second example URL above. This
allows a user to request specific fields of the elements in the specified
table. As an example, a GET request made to &quot;/CADETProc/comments/fields&quot;
shall return a list of all the columns, or fields, that exist within the
&quot;comments&quot; table, such as &quot;comment&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, etc. When the specified table
does not exist, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error shall be returned to the user. When
the table has no columns, an empty list shall be returned to the user.</li>
<li>To retrieve a specific element from a table in the CADET backend database, a
GET request can be made to the third example URL listed above. This will
return an element defined by the ID requested. As an example, a GET request
to &quot;/CADETProc/comments/4&quot; shall return the element with ID 4 existing in
the table &quot;comments&quot;. When the specified table does not exist, a &quot;404 Not
Found&quot; error shall be returned to the user. When the specified ID does not
exist in the table, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error shall be returned to the user.</li>
<li>To retrieve a specific field from a specified element of a table in the
CADET backend database, a GET request can be made to the last example URL
above. The request will return the specified field from the specified
element. As an example, a GET request to &quot;/CADETProc/comments/4/date&quot; shall
return the &quot;date&quot; field from the element with ID 4 existing in the table
&quot;comments&quot;. When the specified table does not exist, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error
shall be returned to the user. When the specified ID does not exist in the
table, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error shall be returned to the user. When the table
or element does not have the specified field, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error shall
be returned to the user.</li>

<p>CADET (Course Assessment using Data Exploration of Text) is an application
developed by students and faculty of [JHU EP]_. This program utilizes Natural
Language Processing (<a class="citation-reference" href="#nlp" id="id1">[NLP]</a>) to examine the sentiments in evaluations left by
students to quantify course and instuctor effectivness. A web service port of
the existing CADET desktop application is being developed. One aspect of this
update is that the web application will have two subsystems, presentation/UI
and data/back-end, hosted on different platforms. This creates a gap in the
flow of processed output from the data layer back to the user. The disconnect
will be bridged by a presentation/UI-side interface which ingests the results
and separates them into constituent parts.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<div class="section" id="platform">
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>Currently, CADET exists as a desktop application, written in Python <a class="citation-reference" href="#python" id="id2">[Python]</a>,
which runs on the user's local machine. This configuration presents two issues:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>User base restricted to students/faculty with access to CADET source code.</li>
<li>Application does not effectively manage the capabilities of host machine.
Evaulating input takes a considerable amount of time, which varies by data
set size and individual machine resources.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-code-modification">
<h2>Source Code Modification</h2>
<p>Porting CADET to a web application should address both these concerns: web
services are accessible to non-technical individuals who may not have an
understanding of how to build applications and off-loading the NLP processing
will decrease local resource cost; additionally providing a conrete baseline
for performance analysis. However, these changes require extensive modification
of the existing source code along with new development. The current CADET
processing flow is comprised of 3 main steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Import file(s) containing structured, unprocessed comment data.</li>
<li>Parse/Evaluate a local copy of the data using Python's Natural Language
Toolkit <a class="citation-reference" href="#nltk" id="id3">[NLTK]</a> to process the text using NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Display the processed information to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>A byproduct of the web application will be the separation/modularization of
presentation and data control aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interface">
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>Once the input data has been processed by the data layer, the result is
returned to the presentation layer (this would fall between steps 2 and 3).
A method by which the processed output of the data layer is gathered and
interpreted by the presentation layer is necessary.</p>

<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>The main focus of this feature is to create an interface that will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Utilize JSON objects with existing code</li>
<li>Access the database API</li>
<li>Retrieve and pass JSON objects</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to accomplish these goals, the current CADET code will need to be
evaluated. The first step in implementing this feature will be to find the
point where the processed comment data is passed from NTLK analysis back to
front end code for display. Currently, this occurs in FileIngesterUtil.py,
via an array of Comments.</p>
<p>The next step is to wrap the Comment array into a JSON object. JavaScript
Object Notation <a class="citation-reference" href="#json" id="id4">[JSON]</a> is lightweight data interchange format. It has become
widely accepted as a convenient way to represent simple data structures.
Altering the application to manipulate JSON objects does not provide any
immediate improvements, but will be necessary for passing data. After the JSON
wrapper has been implemented, the expected Comment members should be changed to
reflect the proposed data structure described by the &quot;Data Analysis
Specification&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d88" id="id5">[D88]</a> feature. That specification document enumerates the JSON
object fields that the data layer will return. The standard Python JSON
[Python JSON]_ library will be used to handle these objects.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the web version of CADET will serparate the presentation
and data aspects of the application. In the specification document for the
&quot;Metadata Retrieval&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d82" id="id6">[D82]</a> feature, the mechanism for accessing processed
comment data is described. This information will be housed in a database which
presents an externally accessible RESTful API interface. REpresentational State
Transfer <a class="citation-reference" href="#rest" id="id7">[REST]</a> is a standard for web APIs which conform to a set of defined
principles. RESTful web services use common command words to send and receive
data through calls to URLs. In this instance, GET resquests to the API will
return the JSON objects mentioned in the last paragraph. A new class will be
developed for the purpose of procuring this data.</p>
<p>Before accessing the API, the class will need to know the ID of the table which
contains the processed data it wants to access. From this information, it will
be able to periodically poll the table's corresponding URL to query status.
Once it has been determined the table is available, the class is able to
discover the topic dictionary and the number Comment entries. It will then
iterate over all the entries, retrieving each as an individual JSON object and
storing them in an array. This array can then be passed out of the class where
the &quot;Dashboard - Display topic comments from data layer&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d93" id="id8">[D93]</a> presentation
layer feature will take over further processing this data.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>The result of the NLTK could be processed before it is stored.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The partition of presentation and data processing/storage better utilizes
anticipated machine resources:<ul>
<li>Presentation layer will run in the browser of the user's local machine,
where resources necessary are ideally minimal, and</li>
<li>Data processing and storage functionality will run on a remote server,
where processing resources are a commodity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A different type of object interchange format, such YAML <a class="citation-reference" href="#yaml" id="id9">[YAML]</a> or MessagePack
<a class="citation-reference" href="#messagepack" id="id10">[MessagePack]</a>, is used to pass data.</p>

<p>CADET (Course Assessment using Data Exploration of Text) is an application
developed by students and faculty of [JHU EP]_. This program utilizes Natural
Language Processing (<a class="citation-reference" href="#nlp" id="id1">[NLP]</a>) to examine the sentiments in evaluations left by
students to quantify course and instuctor effectivness. A web service port of
the existing CADET desktop application is being developed. One aspect of this
update is that the web application will have two subsystems, presentation/UI
and data/back-end, hosted on different platforms. This creates a gap in the
flow of processed output from the data layer back to the user. The disconnect
will be bridged by a presentation/UI-side interface which ingests the results
and separates them into constituent parts.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<div class="section" id="platform">
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p>Currently, CADET exists as a desktop application, written in Python <a class="citation-reference" href="#python" id="id2">[Python]</a>,
which runs on the user's local machine. This configuration presents two issues:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>User base restricted to students/faculty with access to CADET source code.</li>
<li>Application does not effectively manage the capabilities of host machine.
Evaulating input takes a considerable amount of time, which varies by data
set size and individual machine resources.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="source-code-modification">
<h2>Source Code Modification</h2>
<p>Porting CADET to a web application should address both these concerns: web
services are accessible to non-technical individuals who may not have an
understanding of how to build applications and off-loading the NLP processing
will decrease local resource cost; additionally providing a conrete baseline
for performance analysis. However, these changes require extensive modification
of the existing source code along with new development. The current CADET
processing flow is comprised of 3 main steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Import file(s) containing structured, unprocessed comment data.</li>
<li>Parse/Evaluate a local copy of the data using Python's Natural Language
Toolkit <a class="citation-reference" href="#nltk" id="id3">[NLTK]</a> to process the text using NLP techniques.</li>
<li>Display the processed information to the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>A byproduct of the web application will be the separation/modularization of
presentation and data control aspects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interface">
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>Once the input data has been processed by the data layer, the result is
returned to the presentation layer (this would fall between steps 2 and 3).
A method by which the processed output of the data layer is gathered and
interpreted by the presentation layer is necessary.</p>

<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>The main focus of this feature is to create an interface that will:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Utilize JSON objects with existing code</li>
<li>Access the database API</li>
<li>Retrieve and pass JSON objects</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to accomplish these goals, the current CADET code will need to be
evaluated. The first step in implementing this feature will be to find the
point where the processed comment data is passed from NTLK analysis back to
front end code for display. Currently, this occurs in FileIngesterUtil.py,
via an array of Comments.</p>
<p>The next step is to wrap the Comment array into a JSON object. JavaScript
Object Notation <a class="citation-reference" href="#json" id="id4">[JSON]</a> is lightweight data interchange format. It has become
widely accepted as a convenient way to represent simple data structures.
Altering the application to manipulate JSON objects does not provide any
immediate improvements, but will be necessary for passing data. After the JSON
wrapper has been implemented, the expected Comment members should be changed to
reflect the proposed data structure described by the &quot;Data Analysis
Specification&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d88" id="id5">[D88]</a> feature. That specification document enumerates the JSON
object fields that the data layer will return. The standard Python JSON
[Python JSON]_ library will be used to handle these objects.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the web version of CADET will serparate the presentation
and data aspects of the application. In the specification document for the
&quot;Metadata Retrieval&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d82" id="id6">[D82]</a> feature, the mechanism for accessing processed
comment data is described. This information will be housed in a database which
presents an externally accessible RESTful API interface. REpresentational State
Transfer <a class="citation-reference" href="#rest" id="id7">[REST]</a> is a standard for web APIs which conform to a set of defined
principles. RESTful web services use common command words to send and receive
data through calls to URLs. In this instance, GET resquests to the API will
return the JSON objects mentioned in the last paragraph. A new class will be
developed for the purpose of procuring this data.</p>
<p>Before accessing the API, the class will need to know the ID of the table which
contains the processed data it wants to access. From this information, it will
be able to periodically poll the table's corresponding URL to query status.
Once it has been determined the table is available, the class is able to
discover the topic dictionary and the number Comment entries. It will then
iterate over all the entries, retrieving each as an individual JSON object and
storing them in an array. This array can then be passed out of the class where
the &quot;Dashboard - Display topic comments from data layer&quot; <a class="citation-reference" href="#d93" id="id8">[D93]</a> presentation
layer feature will take over further processing this data.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>The result of the NLTK could be processed before it is stored.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The partition of presentation and data processing/storage better utilizes
anticipated machine resources:<ul>
<li>Presentation layer will run in the browser of the user's local machine,
where resources necessary are ideally minimal, and</li>
<li>Data processing and storage functionality will run on a remote server,
where processing resources are a commodity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A different type of object interchange format, such YAML <a class="citation-reference" href="#yaml" id="id9">[YAML]</a> or MessagePack
<a class="citation-reference" href="#messagepack" id="id10">[MessagePack]</a>, is used to pass data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>JSON has a detailed utilization history in similar application domains.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>JSON objects with extisting code</li>
<li>Comments using updated data members</li>
<li>Data store ping mechanism</li>
<li>REST API data retrival
- Include various possible returned error codes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>In-line code will be added to help future developers understand the rationale
and mechanisms used to implement this feature. Formal documentation will be
submitted to the Documentation Team; this will cover the processing flow and
major data structures. As a result of this feature being &quot;under the hood&quot; to
the user, no external interface documentation will be provided.</p>

<p>CADET (Course Assessment using Data Exploration of Text) is a tool that takes
in student course evaluations and uses sentiment analysis and natural
language processing to report the tone of voice, such as positive or
negative, in an evaluation. This information will refect the teaching quality
of a professor over serveral semesters and overall impressions of a course.
Currently, this tool only exists as a desktop application, and the
objective is to make CADET into a web application. A proposed solution is to
refactor the existing front-end code to use Django <a class="citation-reference" href="#django" id="id1">[Django]</a> , a Python
web framework, to make a functional web interface.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>The eventual goal of CADET is to be publicly released and used by the EP
program leadership for school-wide quality class assessment. Turning the tool
into a web application would make it more accessible to users. The existing
code, if ported to a web application in its current state, has too many
errors that would manifest itself in the web application.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>One functional requirement is that the web application has the exact same
functionality as the desktop application, because in order to build off and
expand for future versions, CADET needs to be assured it works in the Django
environment. The functional front-end tasks include uploading files,
displaying the data as a graph to the user, and exporting the data for later
use. Another functional requirement is that the source code will not be
changed from Python, as stated by the product owner. The quality requirements
are that the web application is more user friendly than the Desktop app,
is highly reliable in data processing, and can process files at a fast speed.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>In order to satisfy the requirement of creating a web application that has the
same functionality as its desktop counterpart, the existing code needs to be
refactored. The PyQt5 library that's currently used to create the widgets
cannot easily be converted to a Django application, so the first step is
determining what needs to be refactored and what needs to be rewritten.
Going through each Python file, the front-end code needs to be separated from
the data layer code. Front-end code includes panels, widgets, and checking
the validity of data before it gets process, while data layer code involves
data computation with natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and
data storage. It is vital to be in communication with the back-end team to
ensure that the front-end code refactoring does not create errors in their
layer. New files will be created to store the front-end code and wrapped in
the Django framework. The back-end team has specified that they will be using
Flask framework, as it serves their needs better as specified in <a class="citation-reference" href="#d82" id="id3">[D82]</a> . This
will not affect how we implement our side and communicate to the data layer
because our interactions will be through a REST API (Representational State
Transfer Application Program Interface), and will not matter if the front and
back-end are built on different frameworks.</p>
<p>In the larger system, Django will use HTML code to visually display the new
CADET layout <a class="citation-reference" href="#d77" id="id4">[D77]</a> , and this will allow for testing of the basic
functionality of the existing code. Once it is confirmed that CADET can
upload files, display graphs, and export data, the requirement has been met.
Continuous integration will still need to be conducted when the back-end
is modifying their side of the code to reinforce this requirement.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Other web frameworks could be used besides Django, such as Ruby on Rails
<a class="citation-reference" href="#ruby-on-rails" id="id5">[Ruby-on-Rails]</a> , to wrap around the existing code. This would not be ideal,
as it would require another programming language, Ruby, to be used.
Development will be simpler now and later if there is only one programming
language.</p>
<p>Another alternative is skipping the separation of user interface and data layer
to just wrap it all in Django. Lack of modularity between layers will create
messy code that will be difficult to debug.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Looking at the README.rst file in CADET’s git repo that past developers have
left, it is assumed that at a minimum, CADET can upload files, display the
results in a graph, and store the result as JSON <a class="citation-reference" href="#json" id="id6">[JSON]</a> objects for later
use. Unit testing will be used to ensure that each of these functions are
met. Integration testing will need to be performed once the data layer has
improved their side to ensure that CADET still has basic front-end
functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>Inline comments are a must if future developers are expected to understand
the rational and modularity behind the functionality and class structures.
Each file will contain the function names, parameters, descriptions, and
desired outcomes. A user manual will be created from collaborating between
the Documentation and front-end team to record how to perform the basic
functions of importing/exporting files and displaying graphs.</p>

<p>Johns Hopkins EP Program uses CADET to automatically parse and categorize every
semesters' student feedback for each of the class sections in the program. This
method is relatively new and lacks any documentation or official tutorial for
those that assemble the feedback for review. This specification is for an
official web-based set of documentation outlining additions in functionality
from each semester the project is worked on.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>The new CADET software does not have any official documentation for the
development and maintenance of the program itself. In order to keep track of
the changes that will occur over the life of the project, a method will be
needed to allow the current developers to provide documentation for the next
semesters developers. A simple and efficient way to do this would be to make
the documents accessible to all in the web-based environment.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>Functional Requirements</strong>
- File extension detection to ensure it is a RST document
- Parses referenced RST file to display in XHTML</p>
<p><strong>Quality Requirements</strong>
- Instructions to build and deploy developer documentation should work across
multiple  platforms i.e- firefox, chrome, etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Coding style should be clean, neat, and easy to use</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Primary Actors: User, localhost</li>
<li>Goal: Convert RST files into XHTML and host them on a web server</li>
<li>Goal: Instructions to deploy user manual in a web based platform</li>
<li>Preconditions:
- User follows setup guide for DocUtils <a class="citation-reference" href="#docutils" id="id1">[DocUtils]</a>
- User sets up environment for script
- The CADET program has been hosted to an existing web server
- An RST style document with correct formatting is part of the
repository <a class="citation-reference" href="#rst" id="id2">[RST]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After the user has finished writing their developer documentation, they shall
run the 'rst2html.py' script. If there is an error encountered during the
conversion process, there is an error output to the terminal with details of
the error. If there are errors, the user shall have to rework the RST text file
to address these errors and rerun the script. Once all errors are removed, the
script will successfully generate all XHTML documents in the directory.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Postconditions:
- Correctly formatted XHTML files have been generated
- XHTML files have been moved into directory for web hosting
- A web page that displays the current semester, along with
previous semesters implementation once deployed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>This change will create an automatic process for converting the developer
documentation into web pages for ease of access. It will have a menu to
navigate through each semester and show the added modules and other
functionality along with how to use it. In the future semesters of the project
it will be the job of the documentation team to generate any additional HTML
pages created for the project. This will be a simple task since a script will
be provided to automate the process.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Alternativs Options:
- Source code comments exclusively
- Text document
- Printed document</p>
<p>The web based application for the developer achieves ease of access across
multiple platforms allowing anyone to use it with internet access. Versus the
alternative options, the web-based application will be easier to track changes
across multiple semesters. Also, source code comments can only convey a limited
amount of information whereas web-based pages can also display images and
diagrams helpful for future developers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing will consist of two parts:
1. Testing the platform for deployment, i.e - the Internet browser
2. Checking the format of the submitted file to ensure it is a properly
formatted RST specific text file.</p>
<p>The test cases would be different browser platforms for the instructions but
for simplicity it will be limited to Firefox and Chrome and different text file
extensions will be submitted to ensure correct error handling occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The web-based documentation will be the final product. Additionally there will
be a script repository which will include a readme text file that has all the
necessary setup steps and a step-by-step process of how to run the tool.</p>

<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>The new CADET software does not have any official documentation that gives
a step by step use of the program itself or answers questions a user may have.
Every good software program needs to be accompanied by a well written set of
user guides that contain all of the aforementioned details. A simple and
efficient way to make the user guide accessible to all is a web-based
deployment. Thus, DocUtils <a class="citation-reference" href="#docutils" id="id1">[DocUtils]</a> was chosen to provide an easy to use
script to convert all RST <a class="citation-reference" href="#rst" id="id2">[RST]</a> files containing the developer documentation
into Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) <a class="citation-reference" href="#xhtml" id="id3">[XHTML]</a>, a web formatting
language, for this purpose and shall be hosted on the same site that the UI
team uses for their deployment.</p>
